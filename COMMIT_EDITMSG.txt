feat(leaderboard, ui): Implement dynamic mode-specific leaderboard and player name system

This commit introduces a significantly refactored leaderboard experience and persistent player name management.

Key changes include:
- **Mode-Specific Leaderboard:** The `highscores.json` structure now supports separate top 10 scores for 'classic' and 'ai' game modes.
- **Integrated UI:** The leaderboard display is now part of the `MainMenu` UI, appearing in the bottom-left corner. It dynamically updates when switching between game modes.
- **Improved Leaderboard Display:**
  - Layout has been refined for better alignment, with separate columns for player name (left-aligned) and score (center-aligned).
  - Empty score entries are now represented by placeholders (`-`).
  - Player's current name is highlighted in blue if they appear on the leaderboard for the selected mode.
- **Persistent Player Name Input:** A "Currently playing as:" input field has been added to the `MainMenu`, allowing players to enter their name once per session.
- **Smart High Score Saving:** Scores are now automatically saved to the `highscores.json` based on the active player name and game mode. The system ensures only the highest score for a given player per mode is recorded, preventing duplicate entries. Guest players' scores are not saved.
- **Animation Enhancements:**
  - Corrected the mode switching animation direction for `btn_next`.
  - Added smooth fade-in/fade-out effects during mode transitions.
- **UI Element Refinements:** Ensured the "PLAY" button's font and text color are correctly applied, and addressed various positioning and font display issues for the player name input field.

This commit lays the groundwork for a more robust scorekeeping and user identity system, paving the way for upcoming features like a dedicated Game Over UI and comprehensive settings.
